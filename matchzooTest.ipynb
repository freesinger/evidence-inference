The objective of this study was to find out how many women would be interested in a trial involving postmenopausal hormone therapy (PHT) and how the women\\'s background characteristics and opinions correlated to their interest.ABSTRACT.METHODS:The data come from recruitment questionnaires (n = 2000) sent to women in Estonia in 1998. A random sample of women aged 45 to 64 was drawn from the Population Registry. The trial is a two-group randomized trial comparing estrogen-progestogen therapy with placebo or no drugs. A brief description of the study was attached to the questionnaires. Women were not told at this stage of the recruitment which group they would be assigned to, however, they were told of the chance to receive either hormone, placebo or no treatment.ABSTRACT.RESULTS:After two reminders, 1312 women (66%) responded. Eleven percent of the women approached (17% of the respondents) were interested in joining the trial, and 8% wanted more information before deciding. When the 225 women who stated clearly that they were interested in joining and the 553 women who said they were not interested were compared, it was found that interested women were younger and, adjusting for age, that more had given birth; in other respects, the sociodemographic characteristics and health habits of the interested women were similar to those of the non-interested women. The interested women had made more use of more health services, calcium preparations and PHT, they were more often overweight, and more had chronic diseases and reported symptoms. Interested women\\'s opinions on the menopause were more negative, and they favoured PHT more than the non-interested women.ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:Unlike the situation described in previous reports on preventive trials, in this case Estonian women interested in participating in a PHT trial were not healthier than other women. This suggests that trials involving PHT are more similar to treatment trials than to preventive trials. In a randomized controlled trial, more information should be obtained from those women who decline to participate.BODY.BACKGROUND:Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed so as to avoid bias in scientific research. There are many studies and reviews on factors that promote or hinder interest in participating in treatment trials – both in regard to patients and physicians [see e.g. [1-4]]. Men, patients who are older, less educated and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, non-whites, smokers, and persons lacking adequate social support are more willing to participate in clinical trials. Furthermore, they tend to be more severely ill than those who do not participate. Identified obstacles include patients\\' and physicians\\' disapproval of patients\\' serving as research subjects, a lack of altruistic motives, distrust of the medical profession, a lack of knowledge of what is required of trial participants, and preference for a certain treatment. Many patients do not understand the reasons why treatments should be allocated at random, and this is an important reason why patients choose not to join randomized clinical trials. [5-8]. Disinterest on the part of patients and physicians in participating in clinical trials constitutes a threat to the generalizability of RCTs [9].  There has been much less research on participation in trials studying preventive measures (preventive trials). The data available thus far suggest that there is a difference in the types of people who join preventive trials and treatment trials. Participants in preventive trials tend to be better off than non-participants as regards socioeconomic situation, health habits and health [10-14]. However, most evaluative studies have failed to document adequately the characteristics of persons who were eligible but did not participate [1]. Less is known of physicians\\' motivation as regards including or encouraging people to participate in preventive trials [15]. Preventive drug therapy, and thus trials involving such drugs, are likely to increase in the future, and more information is needed on who wants to take part in preventive trials. Such data are useful in order to increase the recruitment rate as well as to interpret trial results.  By means of a mailed questionnaire in the Estonian Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy (EPHT)-trial, we recruited healthy 45–64-year-old Estonian women for studying the long-term (5-year) health effects of PHT. The trial investigated the immediate effects of PHT on well-being and symptoms, impacts on the experience of the climacteric, on aging and partner relationships, and influences on the use of health services. Furthermore, the trial investigated the placebo effect and trial effect by means of the design as well as their effect on recruitment and compliance. The object of this paper is to report on how many women were interested in participating in such a trial and how sociodemographic characteristics, health, health habits, health services utilization and opinions regarding the menopause and aging influence women\\'s interest.BODY.METHODS:The trial is a two-group randomized trial comparing oestrogen-progestogen therapy to placebo or no drugs carried out in Estonia. The participants were allocated to four random arms forming two groups: the blind group was given an active drug or a placebo, and the non-blind group was given an active drug or no treatment. Women were informed that drugs would be provided for five years. A random sample of women aged 45 to 64 was drawn from the Population Registry and questionnaires were sent to the women. A brief description of the study was attached to the questionnaire and women were invited to participate in the trial if they were found to be eligible. In the letter, women were told about the sampling; that the trial investigated the health problems of perimenopausal and older women in Estonia, especially the long-term effect of hormonal replacement therapy after cessation of periods; and that the drugs would be provided for five years. In this first letter, women were not presented with the trial design in detail, but they were told that the women will be randomly divided into groups of hormone treatment, placebo, or no tablets. Further, they were told that physician examinations will be provided annually, and the possible risks and benefits of PHT were explained. The study plan had been accepted in the Committee of Medical Ethics in Tallinn. The first 2000 women, in the sample of spring 1998, were sent a more detailed questionnaire, which provided more information on the respondents. After two reminders, the response rate was 66% (n = 1 312).  The questions used in this article were structured, with fixed alternatives. As regards current health, women were asked to choose between very good, good, average, poor or very poor; \"very good\" and \"good\" were later combined to \"good\". To measure health status, women were asked if they had or had had chronic diseases, such as cancer (breast, uterus, ovary), myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, hypertension, stroke, thromboses, liver diseases, renal failure, diabetes or icterus. In the case of other symptoms, women were given a checklist of 18 different symptoms or health problems and asked to choose all that they had experienced within the past two weeks. In the case of health habits, questions on current smoking, alcohol consumption and exercise were asked. The choices for current smoking were: no, yes every now and then, and yes daily, how many cigarettes per day. The choices for alcohol consumption were not at all, low, moderate, fairly high and high. Exercise in leisure-time was elicited using the choices not at all, a little, some, a lot, a large amount; \"a lot\" and \"a large amount\" were later combined to \"plenty of exercise\". Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters.  Women\\'s opinions on the menopause were elicited using the statements: \"The menopause is a normal phase in a woman\\'s life, and usually it does not need treatment by a doctor\", and \"A woman does not loose her femininity during the menopause\". Women\\'s opinions concerning PHT were elicited using the statements: \"PHT effectively prevents osteoporosis \", \"PHT should be given to all middle-aged women with (menopausal) symptoms\", and \"PHT should be given to most postmenopausal women\". The possible answers were: I totally agree, I agree somewhat, I don\\'t know, I disagree somewhat, and I totally disagree. In the analyses, the choices \"I totally agree\" and \"I agree somewhat \" were later combined to \"agree\".  After the previous statements came the remark \\'the next questions deal with the menopause and PHT use. Those with normal periods and who do not use PHT may stop here\\'. This mistake resulted in our many missing answers concerning PHT use (see Table 2), and the percentages in Table 2 are given in two ways.

The proportions giving positive or negative aspects are also reported in this article.  Testing the statistical significance of medians was done using Mann-Whitney\\'s U test. Age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by logistic regression, using interested women as the reference group. SAS 8.0 was used in the analyses.BODY.RESULTS:Altogether 2000 questionnaires were sent and after two reminders, 1312 women (66%) responded (Table 1). Non-respondent women were somewhat older and were somewhat more often residents of the capital than were respondents.

Using the whole sample of 2000 women as a basis for calculation, 11% were interested in participating in the trial, 42% did not want to participate,12% wanted to receive more information before deciding, and 28% gave no answer (\\'do not know\\'). (Table 1).  The socioeconomic background characteristics of these four groups were very similar, but women in the \"do not know\" and \"non-interested\" groups were older than interested women. After adjustment for age, it was found that fewer non-interested than interested women had given birth. When the women who had given a clearly positive or negative answer to the question concerning their interest in participating were compared, it was found that interested women had had more contacts with the health-care system – as measured by visits to a physician and a gynaecologist during the previous year – than had non-interested women. (Table 2). Interested women had also used calcium drugs more often, and they more often reported using PHT at some time than did non-interested women.  Health habits, smoking, alcohol use, and exercise did not vary by interest in participating (Table 3). In both groups, more than half were mildly overweight, but heavy overweight was somewhat more prevalent in those interested. Interested women more often had some chronic disease, such as hypertension, cardiac failure or diabetes. (Table 3). There was no difference in regard to subjective current health, or in the proportion of women who had experienced hot flashes, but interested women more frequently reported depression and sleeplessness.

The proportion of missing values varied from 17 to 21% in the \"interested\" group, and from 23 to 26% in the \"non-interested\" group. 2) Reference group: \"non-interested\"   The \"want more information\" group was similar to the group of interested women in regard to the variables studied, but they had had fewer gynaecologist appointments in the last 12 months (40% vs. 53%). The \"do not know\" group exhibited a clearly greater difference from interested women: fewer of them had ever made use of PHT and calcium drugs; they suffered less from irritability, depression, joint pain, sleeplessness, sweating and hot flashes; they had had fewer appointments with gynaecologists because of menopausal symptoms; and they reported fewer both positive and negative aspects of the menopause.BODY.DISCUSSION:In the case of many background characteristics, the interested and non-interested women were similar to each other, or the differences between them were small. The major differences between them were in age, health, use of health services, experience and attitude towards the menopause. When compared to non-interested respondents, interested women were younger, and they suffered from poorer health in terms of chronic diseases, more reported symptoms, and more visits to a physician. Interested women had more negative experiences with the menopause and a more positive attitude to PHT, and they had also more often used PHT than had non-interested women.  As in previous preventive trials, the interested women were younger than those who were not interested [1]. But in contrast to Britton et al. [1], who found that interested women had a more healthy lifestyle, we did not find differences in health habits – except with regard to overweight. The use of health services positively correlated with women\\'s willingness to join this trial. It seems that women\\'s contacts to health services may increase their willingness to join a trial; or use of health services may result from their poorer health: interested women had more chronic diseases and more symptoms. Or women expected some benefits from the trial. In an imaginary trial of PHT, the advantages that the women expected from the treatment was more important than how benefits were described [16].  Interested women\\'s negative experiences with the menopause and positive attitude to PHT, as well as a positive attitude towards PHT on the part of gynaecologists [17], may have influenced women\\'s interest in the PHT trial. By contrast, a fifth of the respondents had no opinion concerning PHT. Its use is still infrequent in Estonia, and knowledge of PHT is likely to have been scant.  A limitation for generalizing the study results may result from our particular trial design and target group. However, the trial design of blind and non-blind groups was not presented in the invitation letter. Women were not told at this stage of the recruitment which group they would be assigned to, however, they were told of the chance to receive either hormone, placebo or no treatment. This trial concerned only mid-aged women, and different factors may influence men, or young and old people. The instruction to stop filling in the questionnaire if the women had regular menstruation and no use for hormone therapy resulted in mainly postmenopausal women being included in this report; PHT use in Estonia was low at the time of the questionnaire.  When one is recruiting participants for a randomized controlled trial, more information should be obtained from those who do not enter the trial. Ellenberg [18] argues that information involving the selection process should be obtained at each stage of selection, beginning with the screening of potential participants and proceeding to the final enrolment of those who agree to take part. This process may establish some basis for judging limits when one is generalizing results of an intervention trial. In the present population-based study, the characteristics of persons who did not return the questionnaire remain largely unknown. We know that they were somewhat older and were more often residents of the capital than were those who were interested in joining the trial. Only 52% of people living in the capital have Estonian as their home language, and language problems in this area may explain the lower response rate to our Estonian-language questionnaires.  This preventive randomized controlled trial differed from previous preventive trials in that interested women had more chronic diseases and symptoms. In this respect they were more similar to the participants of treatment trials, in which interested persons tend to be sicker rather than more interested. Possibly some women did not regard our trial as a preventive trial but wished for better care or treatment than they would receive outside the trial – as is the case in treatment trials [3]BODY.LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS USED:Estonian Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy trial EPHT trial  Postmenopausal hormone therapy PHT  Randomized controlled trial RCT  Women\\'s International Study of long-Duration Oestrogen after Menopause WISDOM  Odds ratio OR  Confidence Interval CIBODY.COMPETING INTERESTS:The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.BODY.AUTHORS\\' CONTRIBUTIONS:SLH participated in the design and the conducting of the study, acquired and analysed the data, and drafted the manuscript; MH participated in the trial design and gave critical comments on the manuscript; PV participated in the study design; MR participated in the study design and acquisition of the data; EH conceived the study and participated in its design, participated in the acquisition of the data and gave critical comments on the manuscript.

No effect on transfusion rate. A randomized controlled trial [ISRCTN87597684]ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:Hypotensive epidural anaesthesia (HEA) combines a high epidural anaesthesia, performing a sympathetic blockade, with low-dose iv-infusion of epinephrine to stabilize circulation in the conscious patient. Mean artery blood pressure is reduced to 45–50 mmHg and hereby a reduced blood loss. In this study we have combined HEA with preoperative acute normovolaemic hemodilution (ANH) in attempt to further reduce the blood loss and need for blood transfusion in total knee arthroplasty surgery (TKR).ABSTRACT.METHODS:Twenty-eight patients scheduled for TKR are randomised to ANH or no hemodilution (non-ANH). Both groups are anaesthetized with HEA. ANH is established with predonation of 20 % of the total blood volume, and replacement with equal volume of HAES 6 %. Blood re-transfusion is completed within 6 h.ABSTRACT.RESULTS:A mean of 877 ml blood was predonated (19.7 % of the total blood volume). Blood loss was, except from the intraoperative loss, significantly higher in ANH group. The total loss was 1306 mL (ANH) vs. 1026 mL (non-ANH), p < 0.05. Except from the first hour postoperatively, hematocrit was identical in between groups postoperatively. The amount of blood transfusion was identical 386 ml (ANH) vs. 343 ml (non-ANH) (ns). 50 % went through surgery without receiving blood (ANH) vs. 58 % (non-ANH). No renal, neurological or cardiopulmonary complications were registered.ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:These data suggest no benefits in combining HEA and ANH in TKR surgery. Probably because of the reduced viscosity of the blood after ANH, there is an increased postoperative blood loss. The need for homologous blood transfusion was identical.BODY.BACKGROUND:The risks associated with banked homologous blood products are well known. These risks include among others: ABO incompatibilities, viral or bacterial infections, and immunosuppression [1]. Immunomodulation may have long lasting effects on the patient who has received a single unit of homologous blood, and may alter the immune response in a way that may render the recipient vulnerable to infection [2]. Several techniques for management of surgical patients without homologous blood transfusion are available. Acute normovolaemic hemodilution (ANH) is the simultaneous exchange of whole blood with an identical volume of an iso-oncotic colloid. The resulting dilutional anaemia is compensated for by an increase in cardiac output and enhanced arterial oxygen extraction. Although bleeding during surgery remains essentially unchanged, blood lost during the surgical procedure contains fewer red cells because the patient\\'s blood has been diluted. At the conclusion of surgery or when needed, donated blood may be returned to the patient [3]. ANH is found to be effective in surgical cases with a high-expected blood loss [4]. The concept of decreasing the arterial blood pressure to hypotensive levels during anaesthesia and surgery has been used for decades in attempt to reduce intraoperative blood loss and to improve conditions in the surgical field. A mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of 55–60 mmHg has been regarded as the lowest safe level in young healthy patients, one of the reasons being that this range represents the lowest MAP at which auto regulation of the cerebral blood flow is still active.  Sharrock introduced the hypotensive epidural anaesthesia (HEA) in 1989 [5]. Epidural anaesthesia was used to establish a sympathetic blockade, causing a hypotensive state. Low dose of epinephrine was infused to maintain and stabilize cardiac output and heart rate. During HEA, a MAP of 45–50 mmHg was allowed since the cerebral condition could be monitored through the patient\\'s ability to communicate, as only slight sedation was used. HEA is a safe technique with a low complication – and mortality rate, even in patients with left ventricular dysfunction [6-8]. This method reduces blood loss and need for transfusions significantly in hip arthroplasty surgery [9]. We have in a previous paper demonstrated a reduced perioperative blood loss at 47 % in knee arthroplasty surgery (TKR) during HEA [10].  The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential benefits of a reduced need for homologous blood transfusion by combining HEA and ANH in TKR surgery.BODY.METHODS:The study was approved by the regional scientific ethics committee and corresponds with the Helsinki II declaration. In all patients written informed consent was obtained.  Twenty-eight patients scheduled for primary cemented TKR surgery were included in the study period. Exclusion criteria were: Patients underage (<18 years), hematocrit < 0.30, recent myocardial infarction (<6 months), unstable angina, diagnosed and clinical symptomatic aortic- or mitral valve stenosis (>30 mmHg), previous stroke, unmedicated hypertension and treatment with beta-antagonists or anticoagulants. No patient was medicated with salicylate or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the two weeks prior to surgery.  On the day of surgery patients were consecutive and blindly randomised to HEA with or without ANH using computerised randomisation to two treatments (MedStat®).  ANH was performed by drawing 20 % of the total blood volume through a venous cannula immediately before anaesthesia. This volume was simultaneously replaced with an equal volume of Hydroxy Ethyl Starch 6 % (HAES 6 %). The following formula was used:  Total blood volume = body weight (kg) × 60 mL per kg.  The donated volume of blood was collected in transfusion bags together with a stabilizer. Until re-transfusion in the recovery room, the blood was storaged in a cooler box. Retransfusion was terminated within 6 hours. Both groups were anaesthetized with the hypotensive epidural anaesthesia technique.BODY.METHODS.HEA:To establish the sympathetic blockade, epidural anaesthesia was performed at the Th12-L1/L1-L2 interspace with ropivacaine 1%, 25–35 ml to achieve analgesia at Th1-2 dermatome. For epidural infusion, ropivacaine 1% 6–8 ml/h was used until end of surgery. The infused dose varied according to the patient\\'s age, height and weight. The arterial pressure decreased progressively over 10 minutes after the epidural bolus injection to a MAP of 45–50 mmHg. In case of insufficient decrease in blood pressure, bolus ropivacaine 5 ml epidurally was used. Infusion of epinephrine 0.01–0.07 μg/kg/min was started immediately after insertion of the central vein catheter; in order to prime the catheter before the sympathetic blockade was established. During surgery sedation with propofol was adjusted to a level where communication was possible. Intraoperative infused fluid volume was in both groups isotonic saline 5 mL/kg/h as basic need and Isotonic saline three times the amount of blood loss as substitution for intraoperative blood loss. Oxygen was delivered at 3 l/min on a nasal catheter. All patients were kept warm, using a Bair-hugger. No knee tourniquet was used.  Monitoring: 5-lead ECG, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, radial- and central venous pressures. All data were continuously recorded on a computer, using the Datex Collect (software (Datex, Denmark).  Infusion of epinephrine was continued postoperatively until MAP reached 75 mmHg, hereafter epinephrine was reduced gradually until removal. In both groups, the intraoperative blood loss was determined by measurement of the volume in the suction apparatus, and by weighing of towels. The postoperative blood loss was determined by measuring the drainage for 48 hours after operation. Drains were removed after 48 hours.  Postoperative analgesia was performed as patient controlled epidural analgesia using ropivacaine 0.2 % and morphine 0.05 mg/ml for three days, according to our normal routine. The epidural catheter was removed on the third postoperative day. Hereafter the patients were treated orally with morphine and acetaminophen. Fragmin® was given as thrombo-prophylaxis. All patients used a continuous passive knee motion apparatus the first two postoperative days.  The patients were anaesthetized by one of the three anaesthesiologist authors and operated by two surgeons. Demographics, hematocrit pre- and post ANH, at arrival at recovery room, and at 1., 2., 3., and 5. postoperative day were recorded. Intra- and postoperative fluid- and blood transfusions were also registered. Blood transfusion was indicated when the hematocrit value was below 28 %.BODY.METHODS.STATISTICS:After passing through the exclusion criteria patients were consecutive and blindly randomised to HEA with or without ANH using computerised random numbers for 2 treatments (MedStat®). The result of the randomisation was known immediately before anaesthesia.  Data are presented as means (SD) or means (range). Comparison between groups was performed with a Student\\'s t-test. For ASA-score a Mann Whitney\\'s test was used. Chi-test was applied on gender and the fraction of transfused patients in the two groups. A p < 0.05 was chosen as significance level.  The sample size of this study was determined by an expected effect of ANH on blood transfusion rate of 50 % (MIREDIF). α = 5 %, β = 10 %, SD = 400  n1 = n2 = 2(t2( + tβ)2SD2/MIREDIF2  Power = (1-β) = 1-0.10 = 0.90  This calculation resulted in 13 patients in each group. We decided to enrol 14 in each group.BODY.RESULTS:In all 33 patients were screened to enter this study. Three patients were excluded because of treatment with beta-antagonists and 2 patients because of previous stroke.  Twenty-eight patients, 14 ANH and 14 non-ANH were enrolled in the study. Patient characteristics and preoperative blood measurements are shown in Table 1. Except from the preoperative mean artery blood pressure (measured before blood donation) there was no significant difference in between groups. Intraoperative values are shown in Table 2. The ANH group was given ropivacaine 1 %, mean 288 ± 32 mg and non-ANH ropivacaine 1 %, 297 ± 22 mg (ns). The intraoperative mean artery blood pressure was identical between groups. MAP demonstrated a reduction of 53.4 % (ANH) and of 58.4 % (non-NAH), compared to preoperative blood pressure (ns).   Table 1 Demographics and preoperative measurements of the patients.

Time used for anaesthesia (from patient enters the operating theatre to entering the recovery room) and duration of surgery was identical between groups. Core temperature on admission to the recovery room was also without a significant difference.  The preoperative donated blood volume was mean 877 mL ± 175, or 19.7 % of the total blood volume. All blood was retransfused to ANH patients in the recovery room.  Perioperative blood loss and substitution are shown in Table 3. At almost all registrations there was a reduced blood loss in non-ANH group. Colloid substitution was in ANH group 679 mL and blood transfusion 386 mL, without including the infusion of HAES used in the ANH procedure and the predonated amount of blood. Fifty percent in the ANH group received homologous blood transfusion during the hospital stay (771 mL pr. patient transfused) vs. 42 % in non-ANH group (800 mL pr. patient transfused) (ns). Numbers of units packed red cells are shown in Table 4. No patients received blood components other than erythrocytes.  Table 3 Blood loss and substitution for the patients.

At the 7\\'Th postoperative day all patients in this study were transferred to a hotel department for further mobilisation. During the hospital stay we did not observe any cases of renal failure according to the Creatinine measurements. All patients were discharged from the hospital alive.BODY.DISCUSSION:In both groups there was a remarkable low total blood loss, due to the anaesthetic technique used (HEA). The blood loss was, especially the non-ANH group, in a range identical with the result of our previous study comparing HEA with normotensive regional anaesthesia in TKR surgery [10]. ANH failed in the present study to demonstrate a reduced need for blood transfusion with homologous blood products during TKR surgery in HEA anaesthesia. We here use a moderate hemodilution (20 % of total blood volume) to a hematocrit near 30% agreeing with the recommendations for patients at this age [11]. Despite of this 50% in the ANH group received homologous blood. In a previous ANH study without the use of HEA anaesthesia, 45 % of TKR patients received homologous blood [12]. A case study analysis of patients who had undergone moderate ANH (15 % of patients blood volume) estimated that only 0.5 unit of blood is \"saved\" [13]. Mathematical models concur that savings are small unless profound hemodilution is accompanied by large blood loss (> 2 L) [14]. Another study postulates that the safety and efficacy of more extensive hemodilution is controversial because it is not possible for all patients and may provide only little additional blood conservation [15].  At almost all registrations the ANH group demonstrated an increased postoperative blood loss compared to the non-ANH group. Dilution of the blood after ANH is the most reasonable explanation to this. TKR surgery is known to be associated with extensive postoperative blood loss, probably because of difficulties in performing postoperative compression and haemostasis of the tissue in the knee [10]. This fact combined with the reduced viscosity of the blood could increase the postoperative blood loss. We did not register any difference in time spent in surgery or postoperative hypotension that could explain differences in the blood loss. In a previous study mild hypothermia was found to be correlated to a significantly increased blood loss in hip arthroplasty surgery [16]. We did not register differences in postoperative core temperature. Another possible explanation for the difference in blood loss could be alternation of the coagulation system because of the hemodilution. ANH is found to cause a slight coagulopathy including a decrease in platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, AT-III and plasminogen. Furthermore APTT is increased. The combination of ANH and prostaglandin E1 induced hypotension to 55 mmHg did not alter the coagulation system any further [17]. Pre- and postoperative platelet count and APTT were in our study without significant differences. The registered difference in the mean age between the groups must be without significant influence on the perioperative blood loss. We found no complications related to the brain or the heart during the hospital stay. In a recently published work, HEA demonstrates identical rates of cardiac and thromboembolic complications in elderly patients compared to normotensive epidural anaesthesia. Furthermore, there were no differences in early or long-term cognitive dysfunction [18]. None of the patients died in the perioperative period, in agreement with the very low mortality described by Sharrock [7].BODY.CONCLUSIONS:HEA is found to reduce the perioperative blood loss and the need for transfusion compared to conventional anaesthesia [9,10], but the combination of HEA and ANH seems in this study to be without any further benefits regarding the blood loss and need for transfusion.BODY.COMPETING INTERESTS:None declared.BODY.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTORSHIP:All three authors carried out the protocol, inclusion of patients, anaesthesia and data collections.

In that trial, however, informing the ED physician of the PRIME-MD results did not increase the frequency of psychiatric diagnosis, consultation or referral. We conducted this study to determine whether telling the patient and physician the PRIME-MD result would result in the majority of PRIME-MD-diagnosed patients being directed toward treatment for their mental illness.ABSTRACT.METHODS:In this single-site RCT, consenting patients with non-specific somatic chief complaints (e.g., fatigue, back pain, etc.) completed the computerized PRIME-MD in the waiting room and were randomly assigned to one of three groups: patient and physician told PRIME-MD results, patient told PRIME-MD results, and neither told PRIME-MD results.  The main outcome measure was the percentage of patients with a PRIME-MD diagnosis who received a psychiatric consultation or referral from the ED.ABSTRACT.RESULTS:183 (5% of all ED patients) were approached. 123 eligible patients consented to participate, completed the PRIME-MD and were randomized. 95 patients had outcomes recorded. 51 (54%) had a PRIME-MD diagnosis and 8 (16%) of them were given a psychiatric consultation or referral in the ED. While the frequency of consultation or referral increased as the intervention\\'s intensity increased (tell neither = 11% (1/9), tell patient 15% (3/20), tell patient and physician 18% (4/22)), no group came close to the 50% threshold we sought. For this reason, we stopped the trial after an interim analysis.ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:Patients willingly completed the PRIME-MD and 54% had a PRIME-MD diagnosis. Unfortunately, at our institution, informing the patient (and physician) of the PRIME-MD results infrequently led to the patient being directed toward care for their psychiatric condition.BODY.BACKGROUND:There is a higher prevalence of psychiatric conditions in patients presenting to emergency departments (ED)s with non-emergent complaints than in the general population [1-4]. On average, patients with untreated psychiatric illness have more frequent ED visits and use more health care services than those in the general public [5,6]. Studies in a variety of ED settings have documented that over 40% of ambulatory patients have underlying psychiatric conditions [1-4]. Since there are highly effective treatments for many psychiatric conditions, these patients are generally expected to achieve better health outcomes if their psychiatric condition is diagnosed and treated, especially when their somatic complaints (weak and dizzy, back pain, etc.) are not amenable to effective treatment. A collateral benefit would be a reduction in societal health care costs [7].  PRIME-MD is a screening tool for psychiatric conditions that uses closed ended questions to make DSM-IV diagnoses [8]. Its diagnostic validity has been established in a number of ambulatory care settings [9-12]. We have demonstrated that the computer version of the PRIME-MD can be used in the ED waiting room to identify patients with underlying psychiatric conditions that might be causing or exacerbating their somatic presenting complaints [4]. Unfortunately, in that study, the emergency physicians ignored the patient\\'s PRIME-MD diagnoses and neither diagnosed nor treated the patient\\'s mental health disorder. The same phenomenon has been observed in primary care [13].  In this study, we conducted focus groups to determine why our first trial failed and then conducted a trial using the stronger intervention of informing both the patient and the physician of the computer\\'s findings. Our goal was to determine whether this intervention would result in the majority of patients with a PRIME-MD diagnosis being referred for evaluation and treatment of their psychiatric condition. By empowering the patient to act as his or her own advocate, we hoped to overcome whatever factors deter physicians from exploring these diagnostic possibilities with the patient. We designed a 3-limb randomized trial that included a control group, a group in which only the patient was informed of the PRIME-MD results and a group in which both patient and physician were informed of the results.BODY.METHODS.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING:Focus groups – An experienced facilitator used a set of open ended probes to conduct two 90 minute focus groups to explore why physicians might be reluctant to pursue psychiatric diagnosis, consultation or referral in patients given a psychiatric diagnosis by PRIME-MD. One group included 6 randomly selected EM residents, the other 6 EM faculty. Two observers took notes and identified main themes and points of disagreement. The results informed the development of the intervention and study materials.  Trial – This randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted at the University of California Los Angeles Emergency Department, a teaching hospital and Level I trauma center. The annual census is 44,000. Study subjects included emergency and internal medicine house staff, emergency medicine faculty, and enrolled patients, all of whom were consented. The study was approved by the UCLA IRB.BODY.METHODS.SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS:Patients age 18 or older presenting to the ED between the hours of 10 a.m. and 9 p.m. on most (84%) weekdays from March to September 2002 were recruited for study participation. A trained research assistant, stationed at the triage desk, listened to each intake interview and identified adults with diffuse somatic complaints (e.g., vague head, abdominal, back or body pain of non-acute onset; generalized weakness; \"don\\'t feel well\") that did not seem to mandate emergency care or did not coincide with physical findings (e.g. complaining of rash but no rash visible). Patients arriving via ambulance, patients in extremis, and patients who indicated they were not comfortable reading English were excluded; as were patients whose symptoms suggested psychiatric illness (e.g. hearing voices, suicidal ideation, anxiety...), patients with recent substance abuse, and patients who already participated in the trial.BODY.METHODS.INTERVENTION:Consenting patients were asked to complete the self-administered, PRIME-MD computerized psychiatric questionnaire (version 1.2, Pfizer, Inc, New York, NY) in the ED waiting room prior to seeing the physician. PRIME-MD poses a series of questions to screen patients in 7 psychiatric domains (mood, anxiety, alcohol abuse, eating disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobia, and somatization). Positive responses to these screening questions trigger additional questions to confirm or reject particular diagnoses within each domain. When the session is complete, the program prints a grid that indicates the presence or absence of 20 specific diagnoses within the 7 domains.  Patients were seated at a computer secluded from the rest of the waiting room. They answered questions using a Fastpoint light pen (Fastpoint Technologies, Stanton, CA). A research associate was present to assist with technical issues, time the session, and record any difficulties with the hardware or software. Upon conclusion of the PRIME-MD interview, but before results were known, the randomization software, using the random number function in STATA 6.0, assigned the patient to one of three groups: results given to patient and doctor (40%), results given only to patient (40%), or results given to neither (20%). Patients in the first two groups were given a packet with their PRIME-MD results, an explanation of these results, a glossary of terms, and a cover letter encouraging them to share their PRIME-MD results with the treating ED physician. All patients, regardless of randomization group, were provided a written invitation to speak with a psychiatric social worker at the conclusion of their ED visit All patients with PRIME-MD diagnoses \"major depression\" or \"r/o bipolar disorder\" were assessed for suicidality by the psychiatric social worker prior to discharge.  The physicians caring for patients in the \"tell both\" group were provided PRIME-MD results through identical pre-printed Post-itTM notes affixed over the parts of the medical record where the resident and the attending write their notes. Each Post-itTM note indicated which PRIME-MD domains were positive (or that the patient had no PRIME-MD diagnoses) and referred the physician to additional materials attached to the chart. These materials included a one-page cover sheet that introduced the physician to PRIME-MD, reviewed the evidence of its validity, and listed the patient\\'s PRIME-MD diagnoses. As part of the study we produced a list of low-cost and no-cost psychiatric care options that could be offered to patients as part of their after care instructions. Unfortunately, many of the agencies on the list have many-month-long waiting lists for patients who do not have an acute psychiatric issue. Apart from these interventions, there was no attempt to alter usual care.BODY.METHODS.METHODS OF MEASUREMENT:The primary outcome was whether each patient diagnosed by the PRIME-MD software left the ED having had a psychiatric consultation or with a referral for further evaluation and treatment of their psychiatric condition. Any indication that the patient was referred to a health care provider for help with a mental health issue, including a statement that the low-cost no-cost sheet had been provided was considered evidence of referral. Secondary outcomes were: whether the ED physician made a psychiatric diagnosis and whether the patient actually received follow-up for the psychiatric condition. This information was gleaned from standardized review of the medical record and after care instructions, and follow-up patient telephone interview which took place 2 to 4 weeks after the visit. We questioned the treating resident just after the patient had left the ED to ascertain whether she was aware of the PRIME-MD results and how she had acted upon them. Patient and physician interview procedures and results can be found in the Appendix.BODY.METHODS.DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING:Two investigators independently reviewed the chief complaints of all enrolled patients (presented independently of all other data) and excluded patients who had been inappropriately entered into the study. Trained research associates abstracted the patient\\'s demographics, chief complaint, diagnoses, psychiatric consultations and psychiatric referrals from the ED medical record to a standardized form. Interrater reliability was assessed on a 10% sample of charts. Abstractor\\'s were blinded to the patients\\' randomization status and PRIME-MD results. STATA 8.0 was used for data verification, database management, and statistical analysis. To maintain anonymity and confidentiality, physician and patient identifiers were dropped during database creation and replaced with randomly assigned numbers.BODY.METHODS.PRIMARY DATA ANALYSIS:We designed this study to estimate the treatment effect with reasonable precision, not to perform formal hypothesis tests [14]. We took a Bayesian approach to this trial and incorporated data from our previous study and other reasonable priors in the analysis [15]. We used beta distributions to model all priors and likelihoods. For the control limb we set a prior distribution of beta (1.2, 15.8) which has a mean of 7% and a 95% credible interval of 0% to 23%. This prior is based on the control limb or our previous trial (7% (3 of 45) successes) but was widened to account for potential differences between the trials. It\\'s information content is equivalent to a 17 person study. For the two other limbs we used beta (0.3, 1.2) distributions which have a mean of 20% and 95% credible interval of 0% to 87%. This wide interval reflected our uncertainty regarding the effect of the intervention and has information content equivalent to a study with a sample size of 1.5 subjects. All Bayesian calculations were performed in FAST*PRO and STATA 8.0 [16].  Our determination of sample size was guided by Bayesian estimations and traditional frequentist calculations. We decided a priori that the intervention was only worth doing if it resulted in more than 50% of subjects with a PRIME-MD diagnosis being offered referral. Our reasoning was that given the myriad of competing demands in the ED setting this particular intervention had to have a substantial impact (not just an incremental improvement over the status quo) in order to justify the cost and effort expended. As mentioned above, the control group of our previous trial had 3 of 45 patients with a PRIME-MD diagnosis receive psychiatric consultation or referral. A frequentist two limb trial would require 21 patients per group (80% power for difference between 50% and 7%, alpha .05). We sought to behav 80 patients in each active limb since we conservatively expected that at least 1/3rd of enrolled subjects would have a PRIME-MD diagnosis (42% did in our first study). Since the prior distribution for the control limb was considerably narrower than for the other limbs, we decided to randomize half that number of patients to this limb so that the posterior distributions of all limbs would be of similar precision.[15]. To conserve resources, we planned an interim analysis once we enrolled 40 patients in each active limb to determine whether the study had any chance of producing a clinically important result. Data analysts were blinded to the identity of the 3 experimental groups and the randomization proportions.BODY.RESULTS.FOCUS GROUPS:There was general uniformity of opinion on the following themes: residents do not feel adequately trained to detect and treat occult psychiatric illness, attending physicians were concerned that focusing on psychiatric issues may cause the housestaff (but not them) to overlook somatic illness, and screening and diagnosis was pointless in a system that lacked any viable means for providing follow-up or treatment. No one questioned the validity of the PRIME-MD. There was heterogeneity of opinion regarding whether the ED was the proper place to screen and diagnose psychiatric conditions even if adequate follow-up was available. Some ED residents and attendings candidly revealed that they \"did not go into emergency medicine to make non-emergent psychiatric diagnoses.\"BODY.RESULTS.RANDOMIZED TRIAL:At the time of the interim analysis and the stopping of the study, 4,054 patients had been triaged. 183 were eligible and 127 were randomized (Figure 1). 14 patients left prior to being seen, 4 did not complete their PRIME-MD session, and 11 patients were excluded after randomization when it was determined they had an unappreciated psychiatric complaint (e.g. \"I haven\\'t slept in 3 nights\"). 95 patients were included in the analysis: 32 in the tell-both limb, 40 in the tell-patient limb and 23 in the tell-neither control limb (Table 1). Frequent chief complaints were musculoskeletal pain or minor trauma (23%), abdominal pain +/- nausea +/- vomiting (23%), weak +/- dizzy (12%), and headache (9%). No resident or attending saw a disproportionate number of patients (Table 1).

PRIME-MD made one or more diagnoses in 51 of the 95 (54%) patients (Table 2). Mood and anxiety disorders predominated. 24 patients were diagnosed with major depression and 4 with r/o bipolar disorder. The psychiatric social worker identified 2 patients in this group who were suicidal. The physicians of both of these patients were informed and appropriate assessment and treatment was instituted.

The traditional, frequentist 95% confidence intervals for the trial can be compared to the 95% credible intervals of the posterior distributions produced by the Bayesian analysis which combines prior beliefs about the results of each limb with the observed data (see text and [14]).   From the physician and patient questionnaires (response rates 41% and 55% respectively, see Appendix for details) we learned that: most physicians with a patient in the tell-both group learned that patients\\' PRIME-MD status from the stickers, not from the patient. Few patients said they told their ED physician about the PRIME-MD results and physicians confirmed that they were seldom told such information. While physicians generally agreed with the PRIME-MD diagnoses, they did not choose to act on them, most commonly because \"the visit wasn\\'t about that issue.\" Only 2 of 28 patients contacted at least 2 weeks after the ED visit reported seeing a physician or mental health care professional about their psychiatric problem.BODY.DISCUSSION:This small trial, when interpreted in the context of our previous trial [4], is sufficient to make the following points: 1) it is feasible to use the PRIME-MD in the ED, 2) there is a high prevalence of psychiatric illness in the ambulatory ED population, 3) in our ED, when physicians or patients or both are informed of the presence of a PRIME-MD psychiatric diagnosis, few psychiatric diagnoses are made and few patients receive consultation or referral to address the problem, 4) our strategy of using the patient to initiate a discussion of the patient\\'s mental health did not work.  While 18% (95% Credible Interval 6%, 36%) of patients in the tell-both group were given consultation or referral, 10% (95% Credible Interval -9%, 28%) more than in the control group, we do not believe that the improvement was of sufficient magnitude to justify using PRIME-MD in the waiting room of our ED.  These findings are a bit disconcerting since the treatments for many of these psychiatric conditions are highly effective and the morbidity of the conditions is considerable. Furthermore, treatments for conditions related to the patient\\'s chief complaints (low back pain, general weakness, etc.) have limited efficacy. It would therefore be highly desirable to develop a method for identifying and treating these patients\\' psychiatric conditions.  The focus groups and this trial suggest that emergency physicians are reluctant to consider psychiatric illness in patients presenting with somatic complaints for reasons such as: discomfort with the content and length of the psychiatric interview, lack of knowledge of diagnostic criteria, lack of interest in the activity, and belief that the activity is futile since the health care system provides few resources for the non-psychotic, underinsured patients who are the most likely target of this intervention. It might be possible to have the computer refer patients directly to providers, thereby bypassing the physicians\\' resistance, but this could only occur in a system where viable referral options exist. Until such time, it is unlikely that a successful intervention can be developed until readily available follow-up becomes available.  This study took place in a U.S. academic ED within a health care system that provides extremely limited mental health follow-up for underinsured and uninsured patients who are not homicidal, suicidal or floridly psychotic, the majority of patients in our study. Results might be different in a system (such as the U.K.\\'s) that provides reasonable treatment options for such patients. The inclusion criteria are somewhat subjective. It is quite likely that eligible patients were missed. Furthermore, it is possible that PRIME-MD produced false positive and false negative results. Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that these selection and misclassification biases would affect our conclusion. The small size of our study makes our estimates imprecise, but not so much so that our conclusions are jeopardized. The poor response rates for physician and patient questionnaires seriously compromises their utility.  We powered the study to look for large effects and cannot comment on whether the use of PRIME-MD produces a modest increase in psychiatric diagnosis and referral in patients with occult psychiatric illness. In retrospect, we might have listened to the focus group participants more carefully. They candidly told us why they were not keen to diagnose and treat these patients. We ignored this and designed an intervention that attempted to use the patients to force their hand. We might have had more success had we organized a follow-up clinic for such patients and directly addressed the physicians\\' attitudes. We also learned that while the trained undergraduate student research assistants did quite a good job identifying, consenting, and enrolling patients, they were less effective with the physician questionnaire (40% completion rate). We were unrealistic to expect that a junior person could capture the attention of a busy ED resident to get the questionnaire completed. Finally, we might have used block randomization to avoid the imbalance in assignments that occurred in this study.BODY.CONCLUSION:In summary, in our ED, telling PRIME-MD diagnoses to the patient (and physician) did not substantially increase the proportion of patients whose were diagnosed and referred for treatment of their psychiatric condition in a health care system that offered extremely limited follow-up possibilities for such patients.BODY.COMPETING INTERESTS:The study was funded in part by an unrestricted gift from the Pfizer Corporation. Apart from providing financial support, Pfizer had no involvement in the planning, conduct, analysis or reporting of the trial.BODY.AUTHORS\\' CONTRIBUTIONS:DS and PG conceived and designed the study. PG and WN coordinated the study. CL conducted the patient interviews and performed many of the psychiatric interviews. All authors participated in the drafting and editing of the manuscript. DS takes responsibility for the conduct and reporting of the research.BODY.APPENDIX.PHYSICIAN QUESTIONNAIRE:Participating residents were approached as soon as each patient was discharged from the ED, regardless of randomization status. A research assistant administered one of two versions of a structured questionnaire. Physicians whose patient had a PRIME-MD diagnosis were asked whether they knew the PRIME-MD diagnoses, how they came to know them, whether they agreed with them (and why), and whether they took any actions (and why). Physicians whose patient did not have a PRIME-MD diagnosis were asked if they knew the patient\\'s PRIME-MD status.BODY.APPENDIX.PATIENT QUESTIONNAIRE:The psychiatric social worker attempted to call each patient during a 2 week interval beginning 2 weeks after the ED visit. Each patient had been asked to provide a current phone number at the time of behaviour. Patients were asked 15 closed-ended questions about their current physical and mental health in comparison to the day of the ED visit, their knowledge of their PRIME-MD diagnoses, whether they discussed PRIME-MD with their ED physician, whether their ED physician addressed psychiatric issues during their visit, whether they had been given a referral regarding psychiatric issues, and what types of health care they had received subsequent to the ED visit. At the end of the interview, the social worker attempted to help patients who desired intervention but had not received it find an appropriate source of care.BODY.RESULTS.PHYSICIAN QUESTIONNAIRE:19 of 44 (43%) physicians whose patient did not have a PRIME-MD completed the short questionnaire. 3 of the 4 physicians in the tell-both group knew that the patient did not have a PRIME-MD psychiatric diagnosis. In none of the other 15 cases did the physician know the patient\\'s PRIME-MD status.  20 of 51 (39%) physicians who treated patients with a PRIME-MD diagnosis completed the long-form questionnaire. In 10 of the 20 cases, the physician knew the patient\\'s PRIME-MD diagnosis, including 7 of 8 cases in the tell-both group, 3 of 9 physicians in the tell-patient group, and 0 of 3 patients in the tell-neither group. The physician agreed with all of the PRIME-MD diagnoses in 5 of these cases, agreed with some in 4, and was unsure in 1.  6 of the 10 physicians unaware of the patient\\'s PRIME-MD diagnoses agreed with all (2) or some (4) of them when informed of them. 1 disagreed, 2 had no opinion, and 1 did not answer. Only 2 of these 10 physicians wished that they had known the PRIME-MD diagnoses prior to beginning the patient interview.  6 physicians stated that they informed the patient about a psychiatric diagnosis (4) or wrote one in the medical record (4). The physicians who did not cited reasons such as \"I was not confident of my diagnosis,\" \"I did not want to antagonize my patient,\" \"I did not want to stigmatize the patient,\" and \"that was not what this visit was about.\" 2 physicians stated that they referred patients for further evaluation and treatment of their psychiatric condition. Those who did not cited \"Did not believe patient would benefit,\" \"ED not the place for this activity,\" and \"patient did not meet DSM criteria for major depression,\" in addition to the aforementioned reasons.BODY.RESULTS.PATIENT QUESTIONNAIRE:Despite confirming phone numbers at the time of behaviour, and making up to 10 attempts at contact, we reached only 28 of the 51 patients with a PRIME-MD diagnosis. Most patients reported that their physical health and mental health were somewhat or greatly improved. 1 patient reported that her physical health had worsened. 1 patient reported that his mental health had deteriorated. Both of these patients had been provided with psychiatric referrals but neither had received care.  14 of 21 patients who were told their PRIME-MD status in the ED remembered it at the time of the call. Of these 14 patients, all but one correctly stated whether or not they had PRIME-MD diagnoses, although they were somewhat confused about which diagnoses they had, particularly with regards to the presence of mood or anxiety disorders. 5 patients (none from the control group) reported discussing their PRIME-MD status with their ED physician. 2 reported seeing a mental health specialist subsequent to the ED visit.  12 patients found the PRIME-MD evaluation \"somewhat\" or \"very\" helpful, 2 found it \"somewhat harmful\" and 14 were neutral. 22 were glad that they took it. None of the 6 who were not glad had a PRIME-MD diagnosis. Patients were generally grateful for the call and were generally not that concerned that their mental health needs (as identified by PRIME-MD) had not been met.BODY.PRE-PUBLICATION HISTORY:The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:   xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">'], [1156925, 'TITLE: Effect of increased convective clearance by on-line hemodiafiltration on all cause and cardiovascular mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients – the Dutch CONvective TRAnsport STudy (CONTRAST): rationale and design of a randomised controlled trial [ISRCTN38365125]ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:The high incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) is related to the accumulation of uremic toxins in the middle and large-middle molecular weight range. As online hemodiafiltration (HDF) removes these molecules more effectively than standard hemodialysis (HD), it has been suggested that online HDF improves survival and cardiovascular outcome. Thus far, no conclusive data of HDF on target organ damage and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are available. Therefore, the CONvective TRAnsport STudy (CONTRAST) has been initiated.ABSTRACT.METHODS:CONTRAST is a Dutch multi-center randomised controlled trial. In this trial, approximately 800 chronic hemodialysis patients will be randomised between online HDF and low-flux HD, and followed for three years. The primary endpoint is all cause mortality. The main secondary outcome variables are fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events.ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:The study is designed to provide conclusive evidence whether online HDF leads to a lower mortality and less cardiovascular events as compared to standard HD.BODY.BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is common among hemodialysis (HD) patients. In fact, approximately 50% of the deaths is attributed to cardiovascular causes, which is much higher than in the general population [1]. In addition, chronic HD patients suffer from atherosclerotic complications at a relatively younger age and die younger from ischemic heart disease [2]. The origin of CVD in chronic HD patients is most probably multi-factorial, as the extremely high prevalence in this patient group is not easily explained by traditional risk factors, either alone or in combination [3]. In recent years, other contributing factors have emerged, including the accumulation of uremic toxins, disturbances in the immuno-inflammatory system, as reflected by a chronic micro-inflammatory state, increased oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction [4-6]. In particular the retention of larger uremic toxins, the so-called middle molecules (MM, molecular weight [MW] 0.5 – 50 kDa), may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CVD [7,8]. Therefore, it is conceivable that dialysis modalities with superior MM removal reduce CVD and improve survival.  In contrast to diffusive dialysis strategies, which mainly remove small MW solutes, such as urea and creatinine, convective dialysis strategies are particularly effective in the removal of larger molecules. In hemodiafiltration (HDF), diffusive and convective transport are combined, providing an optimal removal of both small and larger MW substances up to the range of 30 – 40 kDa. Clinical studies have shown that beta-2-microglobulin (β2 m), which is a typical MM with a MW of 11.8 kDa and therefore incapable of passage through the membrane of low flux devices, is effectively removed during HDF leading to lower pre-dialysis levels in the long term [9,10]. Similarly, the removal of other MM such as advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), leptin, and complement factor D is enhanced by convective transport [11-13]. Apart from the increased MM clearance, it has been suggested that HDF improves the removal of smaller molecules that are highly protein bound, due to a better elimination of the unbound fraction [14]. With respect to homocysteine, which is >90% protein bound, the observed decrease may also be explained by an improved removal of uremic substances with inhibitory effects on its metabolism [15]. Finally, it has been shown that treatment with online HDF leads to lower plasma phosphate concentrations, as compared to standard HD [16,17].  At present, it is unclear whether HDF has a favourable effect on the micro-inflammatory state in dialysis patients. Although a reduction of pro-inflammatory proteins has been shown during HDF [18], anti-inflammatory cytokines may also be removed. Of note, besides solute removal, other factors may influence the inflammatory-state as well, such as the bio-incompatibility of the dialyser membrane and the microbiological quality of the dialysate [19,20]. Considering oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, data on the effects of HDF on these parameters are limited.  In summary, compared to standard HD, HDF improves the uremic state by an increased clearance of MM and other, mainly protein bound, uremic toxins. Circumstantial evidence implies that these effects result in less vascular damage and ultimately in decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (figure 1). Although observational studies suggest that online HDF improves cardiovascular outcome in chronic HD patients [21,22], two small randomised studies failed to show any differences between online HDF and standard HD [23,24]. However, the latter analysis lacked adequate power to detect differences in clinical endpoints.  Based on the above-mentioned theoretical considerations, the scarcity of reliable clinical data, and the growing interest in convective techniques under nephrologists, the CONvective TRAnsport STudy (CONTRAST) has been initiated. CONTRAST is a randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of online HDF on clinical endpoints, compared to low-flux HD. If online HDF indeed leads to an improvement in CV morbidity and mortality, this finding will imply a breakthrough in the treatment of chronic HD patients.BODY.METHODS.OBJECTIVES:The primary objective of CONTRAST is to assess the effect of on-line HDF on all cause mortality, when compared to standard low-flux HD. The main secondary outcomes are fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. Other secondary outcome measures include differences between treatment regimens on the progression of left ventricular mass index (LVMi), as assessed by echocardiography, the progression of atherosclerosis as assessed by measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and the progression of arterial stiffness, as assessed by measurement of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV). Furthermore, several laboratory markers of endothelial function, inflammatory state, and oxidative stress will be assessed over time and compared between the two treatment groups. In addition, subjective global assessment (SGA) is performed in the study patients as a measure of nutritional state, and a questionnaire is used to investigate the effects of on-line HDF on quality of life.BODY.METHODS.STUDY DESIGN:In this randomised controlled trial, participants are randomised centrally into a 1:1 ratio for treatment with online HDF or treatment with low-flux HD. Randomisation is stratified by the participating centres and occurs in blocks. The follow-up period is three years. At present, 24 dialysis centres have agreed to recruit the required number of patients. The study is conducted according to good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines.BODY.METHODS.STUDY DESIGN.PATIENTS:The in- and exclusion criteria are given in table 1. Since the study results may be of importance for chronic HD patients of all ages, no upper age limit has been set. Severe incompliance is defined as non-adherence to the dialysis prescription, especially the frequency and duration of dialysis treatment. Permission for participation in other (e.g. observational) studies will be discussed with and decided by the executive committee.   Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria patients treated by HD 2 or 3 times a week, for at least 2 months. patients able to understand the study procedures. patients willing to provide written informed consent. Exclusion criteria current age < 18 years treatment by HDF or high flux HD in the preceding 6 months severe incompliance life expectancy < 3 months due to non renal disease participation to other clinical intervention trials evaluating cardiovascular outcomeBODY.METHODS.STUDY DESIGN.STABILISATION PERIOD:Before randomisation, patients will be dialysed 3 times (or 2 times) per week with low-flux synthetic dialysers (UF-coefficient < 20 ml/mmHg/h) for at least 6 months in case of a prevalent dialysis patient and at least 2 months in case of a new dialysis patient.  Blood flow will be maintained at 250–400 ml/min. Anticoagulation is performed with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) before HD. Patients on coumarins receive 50% of the LMWH dose. Treatment times will be adapted to a target dialysis spKt/V urea of ≥ 1.2 per treatment. Ultra pure water is used for preparation of dialysis fluid. Bicarbonate is provided from powder cartridges to avoid the risk of a bacterial load from bicarbonate concentrates. For instance, the biBAGR system (Fresenius) and BiCartR system (Gambro) will be used. The dialysate flow is 500 ml/min and the temperature of the dialysate is 36°C.BODY.METHODS.STUDY DESIGN.ROUTINE PATIENT CARE:Metabolic control will be performed according to the guidelines of the Quality of Care Committee of the Dutch Federation of Nephrology. Anti-hypertensive medication, lipid lowering therapy, platelet aggregation inhibitors and medication to treat renal anemia and renal osteodystrophy will also be prescribed according to these guidelines, and, if not available, according to usual care.BODY.METHODS.STUDY DESIGN.RANDOMISATION:The patients will be randomised as soon as they are considered to be stable. When a patient has been randomised for low-flux HD, the treatment as performed in the stabilisation period will be continued. Treatment times will be adjusted only if dialysis spKt/V urea < 1.2 per treatment or if ultrafiltration goals can not be achieved, according to the attending nephrologist. When randomised for online HDF, patients will be treated with a target post-dilution dose of 6 l/h (~100 ml/min) and a high-flux synthetic dialyser (UF-coefficient > 20 ml/mmHg/h). Blood flow will be set at >300 ml/min, if possible, in order to achieve a substitution volume of 100 ml/min. If the blood flow is less than 300 ml/min, the post-dilution volume will be decreased accordingly (filtration and post-dilution <25–33% of blood flow). If necessary, the dose of LMWH will be increased and given in two separate doses. Treatment times will be fixed according to the prescription in the stabilisation period and adjusted only when spKt/V urea is < 1.2 / treatment. Metabolic control and medication is similar to the low-flux group, as described above.BODY.METHODS.STUDY DESIGN.DIALYSER MEMBRANES:Dialysers with comparable biocompatible membrane material and surface area will be used in both treatment groups, to ascertain that differences in clearance result from differences in convective transport, rather than differences in dialyser characteristics. Only if the target dose of 6 l/h post-dilution is not achieved in the online HDF patients, it is allowed to prescribe a membrane with a larger surface area. The membranes advised by the study group are summarised in table 2. As many low-flux membranes with a membrane surface > 1.5 m2 have a UF coefficient 10–20 ml/mmHg/h, in this study low-flux is defined as a UF coefficient of < 20 ml/mmHg/h.

As fluid removal exceeds the desired weight loss of the patient, fluid balance is maintained by the infusion of a pyrogen-free substitution solution. In addition, dialysate is used to create a concentration gradient for solute removal by diffusion, as in standard HD. At the introduction of HDF more than 20 years ago, the substitution fluid was supplied in bags. The infusion volumes were limited due to the high costs and laborious procedure, limiting the efficiency of HDF.  In recent years, however, technical advances have made it possible to prepare the substitution solution online from ultra pure water and dialysate concentrates. As a result, the volume of the substitution fluid could be increased considerably, without the disadvantages of inconvenient bags. Hence, the UF rate can be increased up to 50L per treatment in the pre-dilution mode and 25L in the post-dilution mode [25].BODY.METHODS.STUDY DESIGN.ONLINE DIALYSATE AND SUBSTITUTION FLUID PREPARATION:Ultra-pure water is used for the preparation of bicarbonate-containing dialysis fluid, which undergoes one step of ultrafiltration converting it into ultra pure dialysis fluid. Dialysis fluid is produced at a rate of 600–800 ml/min of which approximately 100 ml/min is diverted for further processing into substitution fluid. The electrolyte composition of the dialysis fluid is: Na+ 138–140 mmol/l; K+ 1.0–3.0 mmol/l; HCO3 - 30–35 mmol/l; Ca++ 1.0–1.7 mmol/l; Mg++ 0.5 mmol/l; Cl- 108–109.5 mmol/l; glucose 0–5.6 mmol/l; acetate 3 mmol/l.  The substitution fluid is prepared from the dialysis fluid by one additional step of controlled ultrafiltration, before it is infused post-filter into the blood. The electrolyte composition of the substitution fluid is the same as the composition of the dialysis fluid. Ultrafiltration procedures will be performed according to the manufacturers\\' instructions, as described below.  - The on-line system, ONLINEplusTM (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) is integrated into the dialysis machine (4008 series; Fresenius Medical Care) and consists of two ultrafilters (DIASAFE® plus), an infusate pump module, and disposable infusate lines. Infusate is prepared continuously by double-stage ultrafiltration. Both filters are subjected to automated membrane integrity tests before dialysis, and are replaced after 100 treatments or 12 weeks of use, whichever comes first. Dialysis fluid downstream from the first filter stage enters the dialyser; part of the stream is subjected to cross-flow filtration in the second filter in order to produce infusate. The infusate stream is connected with the venous bubble catcher for post-dilution HDF [25,26].  - The AK 100/200 ULTRA dialysis machine (Gambro AB, Lund, Sweden) prepares ultra pure water and ultra pure dialysis fluid by stepwise ultrafiltration of water and bicarbonate -containing dialysis fluid (BiCart) using two polyamide ultrafilters (U8000 S). When used for HDF, sterile non-pyrogenic solution is prepared on-line from the ultra pure dialysis fluid by an additional step of ultrafiltration using a sterile polyamide ultrafilter (U2000) integrated in a sterile line set (Steriset). The hygiene of the fluid pathway, including the U8000S ultrafilters, will be assured by heat disinfections after each treatment. The U8000S filters are changed bimonthly. The final ultrafilter (U2000) is employed on a single-use basis [26,25].BODY.METHODS.DATA COLLECTION.BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP DATA REGISTRATION:At baseline, all relevant information will be documented: i.e. demographical data, information on cardiovascular risk factors, time on dialysis, cause of renal insufficiency, and medication. A follow-up visit will be scheduled every three months. During this visit, the occurrence of CV events, death, and hospitalisation will be documented. In addition, blood pressure, body weight and the achieved filtration and substitution dose per treatment will be registered. Case record forms are provided using the TeleForm system (version 8.1.1, Cardiff Software Inc, Vista, CA, USA). As all completed forms are scanned, no data entry by typing is needed. Registration of all data will be performed in each centre by the attending nephrologists and research nurses.BODY.METHODS.DATA COLLECTION.RECORDING OUTCOME EVENTS:CV events include fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, therapeutic coronary procedure (PTCA or stenting), therapeutic carotid procedure (endarterectomy or stenting), and PTA and vascular intervention (revascularisation, PTA or stenting). Congestive heart failure is excluded as a CV event, since the discrimination with fluid overload is often hard to make in chronic HD patients. Furthermore, hospitalisations, duration of the hospitalisations and main diagnosis (including the occurrence of infections) will be recorded during the study period.  An independent event committee will evaluate all causes of death, cardiovascular events, and infections. The primary investigators will collect sufficient information of the events for the event committee. The event committee is blinded for information on the received treatment and consists of physicians with different specialisations: neurologists, vascular surgeons, nephrologists, internists, and cardiologists. Events will be coded as fatal and non-fatal, definite, probable and possible and not codeable (i.e. insufficient information). Only definite and probable events will be used in the final analysis. This procedure is successfully applied in a number of studies coordinated by the Julius Center, e.g. in the SMART study [27].BODY.METHODS.DATA COLLECTION.LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY:Using transthoracic M-mode echocardiography from the parasternal long axis position, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), end-systolic diameter (LVESD) as well as posterior and septal wall thickness will be determined at baseline, after 6 months, after 12 months and annually afterwards, on a midweek non-dialysis day according to a central uniform protocol. From these parameters left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) will be determined as LVEDD – LVESD/LVEDD, while the left ventricular mass index (LVMi) will be calculated using the formula of Devereux and Reichek [28], modified in accordance with the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography [29]. The ultrasound investigations will be recorded on a compact disc and analysed off-line by experienced cardiologists in a core laboratory.BODY.METHODS.DATA COLLECTION.VESSEL WALL MEASUREMENTS:With respect to carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), the outcome is the change in mean common CIMT, defined as the average of the intima-media thickness measurements performed circumferentially at pre-defined angles for the near and far wall of 10 mm segments of the right and left distal common carotid arteries [30]. A limited number of centres will be involved in the CIMT measurements in this study. Centres will be trained according to a central uniform carotid ultrasound protocol. Before actually starting the study, sonographers need to be certified as outlined in the CIMT ultrasound protocol.  Measurements will be performed at baseline and then annually on a midweek non-dialysis day. The ultrasound scan is being recorded on videotape and analysed off line by a core laboratory. Quality Assurance and Quality Control procedures as existing and applied in several (inter)national trials will be implemented [31,32].  Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is determined to provide additional information on functional changes of the arterial wall [33]. The outcome measurement is the change in aortic PWV. A limited number of centres will be involved in the PWV measurements in this study. Centres will be trained according to a central uniform PWV protocol. Data are checked regularly on quality control aspects as defined in the PWV protocol as described earlier [34].  Measurements will be performed at baseline and then annually on a midweek non-dialysis day.BODY.METHODS.DATA COLLECTION.NUTRITIONAL STATE:At base-line, after 1, 2 years and at the end of the study, nutritional state is assessed by subjective global assessment (SGA), pre-albumin and dry weight [35].BODY.METHODS.DATA COLLECTION.QUALITY OF LIFE:Patient well-being will be estimated at baseline, and once a year by the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SF). This version is validated in American and Dutch dialysis patients [36,37].BODY.METHODS.DATA COLLECTION.LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS:Three monthly, blood samples will be drawn for routine laboratory assessments. In addition, blood samples will be taken at baseline, and after 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months for determinations of oxidative stress, inflammatory and endothelial function markers. Finally, a whole blood sample will be stored for future research on the effect of genetics on the response to HDF, after specific permission of the patients in the informed consent form.BODY.METHODS.STATISTICAL METHODS:The results of the study will be analysed according to the \\'intention to treat\\' principle.BODY.METHODS.STATISTICAL METHODS.PRIMARY OUTCOME:The primary outcome variable is the time until the occurrence of an event defined as \\'all cause mortality\\'. Results will be presented as Kaplan-Meier curves for the two treatment arms and the difference between the two treatments will be analysed using a log-rank test. The log-rank test will be adjusted for the effect of cumulative data analyses (see below).BODY.METHODS.STATISTICAL METHODS.SECONDARY OUTCOMES:CV events are considered as secondary outcome variables. They will be analysed and presented as described for the primary outcome variable.  The primary analysis of CIMT progression will employ a linear random coefficient (Laird-Ware) model using real visit days, treatment and clinical center as independent variables. for each participant, the intercept and slope of CIMT change over time is assumed to be a normally distributed random variable with different means for the two treatment groups. The mean slope for the HDF treatment group will be compared to that for the low flux group using linear contrasts and a 5% significance level. Additional exploratory analyses will evaluate the impact of including baseline CIMT, lumen diameter, and ultrasound reader as additional co-variates.  The data analytic approach to arrive at the PWV outcome variable and the LVMi outcome variable is similar to that of the CIMT outcome. Adjustments that will be taken into account in the estimates are changes in MAP and changes in heart rate, since both are closely related to PWV.BODY.METHODS.STATISTICAL METHODS.SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS:The sample size of the present study is based on the following event rates: the 3-year all cause mortality rate among subjects with ESRD is 44% based on data from the Dutch renal replacement registry (RENINE) [38]. CV mortality constitutes 40–60% of the total group of deaths, leading to a 3 year CV mortality rate of 22% in HD patients. Assuming that the incidence of non-fatal CVD is equal to the CV mortality rate (22%), the three-year incidence of fatal and non-fatal CVD is 44%. In addition, based on experience ± 8% of the ESRD patients will undergo renal transplantation yearly and as such is being censored in the trial.  Assuming that HDF will reduce all cause mortality with 20%, it has been estimated that with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80%, about 772 patients need to be enrolled and followed for three years. In these patients about 250 events are expected to come to a decision. Note that the total number of patients to be included cannot be specified in advance because of the planned sequential interim analyses, as described below.BODY.METHODS.STATISTICAL METHODS.INTERIM ANALYSIS:In this study, group sequential interim analyses will be performed to evaluate the primary outcome variable. The reason for this approach is that, on average, fewer patients are needed in the study when the expected difference in the primary outcome variable is real or when no difference of the hypothesised magnitude can be expected anymore.  Sequential analysis is a statistical approach where one conducts significance tests over time as the data are collected. Sequential analysis and its application in clinical trials have been described extensively by Whitehead [39]. Sequential design and analysis is implemented in the computer program PEST version 4 [40].  The general approach is as follows. A null hypothesis H0 and an alternative hypothesis H1 are formulated for a suitable measure θ of treatment difference. For this study with a survival type outcome variable, θ is equal to the negative of the logarithm of the hazard ratio (HR). The HR is defined as the ratio of the logarithm of the (expected) cumulative survival under HDF (= 0.648) and the logarithm of the (expected) cumulative survival under HD (= 0.56). H0 is formulated as \"no difference in the occurrence of the primary endpoint between the two trial arms\" or θ = 0 (i.e. HR = 1). The alternative hypothesis H1 is formulated as |θ| ≥ -log(0.75) = 0.29. Two test statistics, Z and V, can be derived depending on the type of response variable. Z is a measure of the treatment difference; for survival data Z is the observed number of events in the control group minus the expected number of events given treatment equivalence. V reflects the amount of information about θ contained in Z; for survival data V is approximately equal to a quarter of the number of events observed. The sequential analysis requires critical boundaries to be specified in advance. These boundaries depend on θ, the type I error α and the power 1-β. For each new group of patients, values of Z and V are calculated and presented graphically by plotting Z against V (see Fig. 2 for an illustration of a double-sided sequential test). Based on the path of cumulative (Z,V)-points, one of the following three decisions is made:  1) the upper or the lower (continuous) boundary is crossed: stop the data collection and reject the null hypothesis;  2) one of the inner wedge-shaped (dashed) boundaries is crossed: stop the data collection and accept the null hypothesis;  3) continue the data collection: the cumulative data are inadequate to draw a conclusion yet.  An independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will evaluate the results of the sequential interim analyses. The DSMB consists of a biostatistician (chair), a nephrologist, an internist, and a clinical epidemiologist. The biostatistician will perform the sequential analyses. The executive committee will provide the DSMB every 2 months with the relevant database to perform the unblinded analyses. The main task of the DSMB is to decide whether the analyses provide enough evidence of either efficacy or no efficacy with respect to the primary outcome and formulates recommendations for the executive committee on the continuation of the trial. The DSMB may also offer unsolicited recommendations on the continuation of the trial, for example after publication of results of similar trials.BODY.CONCLUSION:Online HDF is gaining popularity, as recent technical advances have made it possible to safely replace considerable amounts of fluid at reasonable cost. In addition, accumulating evidence indicates that the correction of the uremic state is improved by online HDF, if compared to standard HD. However, at present it is unclear whether long-term treatment with HDF ultimately results in an improved clinical outcome. Therefore, CONTRAST is initiated, a randomised controlled trial of sufficient sample size to detect differences in survival and cardiovascular events. Patients will be randomised between low-flux HD and online HDF and followed for 3 years. Over 20 Dutch dialysis centers participate in this study and approximately 800 incident and prevalent HD patients will be recruited. By April 2005, more than 150 patients were included.BODY.APPENDIX.STEERING COMMITTEE:The steering committee consists of the primary investigators (nephrologists) of the participating centers.

As a model for study of the pathophysiology of sepsis, endotoxin administration to humans has facilitated research into inflammation, coagulation and cardiovascular effects. The present study was undertaken to determine whether endotoxin administration to human volunteers can be used as a model to study the sepsis-associated increase in microvascular permeability.ABSTRACT.METHODS:In an open intervention study conducted in a university medical centre, 16 healthy volunteers were evaluated in the research unit of the intensive care unit. Eight were administered endotoxin intravenously (2 ng/kg Escherichia coli O113) and eight served as control individuals. Microvascular permeability was assessed before and 5 hours after the administration of endotoxin (n = 8) or placebo (n = 8) by three different methods: transcapillary escape rate of I125-albumin; venous occlusion strain-gauge plethysmography to determine the filtration capacity; and bioelectrical impedance analysis to determine the extracellular and total body water.ABSTRACT.RESULTS:Administration of endotoxin resulted in the expected increases in proinflammatory cytokines, temperature, flu-like symptoms and cardiovascular changes. All changes were significantly different from those in the control group. In the endotoxin group all microvascular permeability parameters remained unchanged from baseline: transcapillary escape rate of I125-albumin changed from 7.2 ± 0.6 to 7.7 ± 0.9%/hour; filtration capacity changed from 5.0 ± 0.3 to 4.2 ± 0.4 ml/min per 100 ml mmHg × 10-3; and extracellular/total body water changed from 0.42 ± 0.01 to 0.40 ± 0.01 l/l (all differences not significant).ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:Although experimental human endotoxaemia is frequently used as a model to study sepsis-associated pathophysiology, an endotoxin-induced increase in microvascular permeability in vivo could not be detected using three different methods. Endotoxin administration to human volunteers is not suitable as a model in which to study changes in microvascular permeability.BODY.INTRODUCTION:Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in noncardiac intensive care units, resulting in an estimated mortality of 200,000 patients per year in the USA alone [1]. Sepsis is notably characterized by an increase in microvascular permeability, which accounts for the extravasation of macromolecules and fluid from the plasma to the tissues. The impaired diffusion of oxygen to cells as a result of the extracellular oedema appears to be a critical factor in the development of multiple organ failure [2,3]. Few studies have been conducted in humans to examine the mechanism that underlies the sepsis-associated increase in microvascular permeability.  Endotoxin is among the principal bacterial components that interacts with the host during Gram-negative sepsis [4]. Administration of endotoxin to humans is an appropriate model in which to investigate acute inflammatory responses (activation of cytokines and coagulation pathways) and to evaluate novel therapeutic interventions [5]. In vitro, exposure of human endothelial cells to endotoxin induces an increase in permeability [6], and in vivo an increase in microvascular permeability is among the major manifestations observed in animal endotoxaemia [7-12]. In humans, microvascular permeability can be assessed by plasma disappearance of a tracer (e.g. I125-albumin), changes in tissue volume caused by an imposed hydrostatic pressure and changes in bio-impedance. These methods were validated for the detection of a modest increase in microvascular permeability in patients with various diseases [13-17] and, more relevant to our study, patients with sepsis or septic shock [18-20]. In septic patients, transcapillary escape rate of albumin varies from 6.7%/hour [21] to 13.4%/hour [18], whereas permeability measured using venous congestion plethysmography (VCP) ranged from 6.1 ml/min per 100 ml mmHg × 10-3 [19] to 9.3 ml/min per 100 ml mmHg × 10-3 [22].  The present study was undertaken to determine whether endotoxin administration to human volunteers can be employed as a model in which to study the sepsis-associated increase in microvascular permeability.BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.SUBJECTS:After approval had been granted by the local ethics committee, 16 nonsmoking individuals gave written informed consent to participate in the study. Those who were taking prescription drugs or asprin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were excluded (except for oral anticontraceptives). Screening of the participants before the test revealed no abnormalities in medical history or physical examination. Routine laboratory tests and electrocardiograms were normal. All participants were HIV and hepatitis B negative. They had not suffered a febrile illness within the 2 weeks preceding the study. Ten hours before the experiment, the participants refrained from consuming caffeine, alcohol and food.BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES:Heart rate was continuously monitored using a three-lead electrogradiograph. An intra-arterial catheter in the radial artery permitted arterial blood sampling as well as continuous monitoring of blood pressure throughout the experiment. Forearm blood flow was measured in both arms using VCP, as described previously [23]. All participant received an intravenous infusion of a glucose/saline solution (2.5% glucose, 0.45% saline; 75 cm3/hour) via a cannula in an antecubital vein. At baseline, purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) prepared from Escherichia coli O113 was injected intravenously (2 ng/kg) over 1–2 min in eight individuals, followed by 5 ml normal saline to ensure complete delivery. Another eight served as control individuals and received NaCl 0.9% instead of endotoxin in an equivalent volume. Because of obvious symptomatic changes after infusion of endotoxin, neither the volunteers nor the staff members were blinded to the study protocol.  The course over time of temperature, C-reactive protein, and plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β [24] were monitored to confirm the inflammatory effects of endotoxin administration.BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.TRANSCAPILLARY ESCAPE RATE OF I125ALBUMIN:Microvascular permeability determined by the transcapillary escape rate of I125-albumin (TER-alb) was measured at baseline and 5 hours after endotoxin administration, when haemodynamic changes are at their maximum [25]. I125 labelled albumin solution of 2 μCi (baseline) and 6 μCi (at 5 hours) in 5 cm3 normal saline were given as an intravenous bolus injection followed by 5 cm3 normal saline. The second dose is higher to overcome the background signal of the first dose. Arterial blood samples were drawn at baseline, and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min. Plasma radioactivity was measured in each sample using a scintillation detector (automatic γ-counter; 1480 Wizard 3\", Wallac, Turku, Finland).BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.VENOUS CONGESTION PLETHYSMOGRAPHY:Microvascular permeability was also determined by VCP, in accordance with methods fully described previously [26,27]. Microvascular filtration capacity (Kf) – an index of vascular permeability – was measured using a protocol in which a series of eight small (10 mmHg) cumulative pressure steps were applied to venous congestion cuffs placed around both upper arms. Kf was estimated from alterations in forearm circumference due to the pressures applied, using the Filtrass strain gauge plethysmograph (Filtrass Angio, DOMED, Munich, Germany) [27]. Using this system, no change in the recorded signal is observed until ambient venous pressure in the arm is exceeded. At congestion cuff pressures greater than this value, each additional pressure increment causes a change in forearm volume that is attributed to vascular filling. When the congestion cuff pressure exceeds the isovolumetric venous pressure, a steady state change in volume is observed, reflecting fluid filtration. Kf reflects the product of the area available for fluid filtration and the permeability per unit surface area. Computer-based analysis enables differentiation between volume and filtration responses [28]. The value of Kf is determined by linear regression of the fluid filtration as a function of the cuff pressure. The slope of this relationship is Kf and the units are expressed as KfU (ml/min per 100 ml mmHg × 10-3) [28]. The files were recorded and saved for subsequent offline analysis. Kf measurements were conducted before, and 4.5 hours and 22 hours after the administration of endotoxin or normal saline.BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.BIOELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS:In septic patients, fluid shifts from intracellular water to extracellular water (ECW) and an increase in total body water (TBW) occur because of an altered cellular membrane function, resulting in the formation of oedema. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) can estimate body composition parameters and has been used to estimate body water distribution and cellular membrane function in healthy individuals [29] and intensive care patients [20,30-33]. The principles of bioelectrical impedance postulate that resistance (R) is the opposition of TBW and electrolytes to the flow of an alternating current of low amplitude (800 μA) and high frequency (50 kHz). Reactance is the capacitance produced by tissue interfaces and cell membranes. An increase in microvascular permeability and an altered membrane function result in the formation of oedema, which decreases the resistance and reactance to an alternating electric current throughout the body. ECW will increase in relation to TBW, and reactance/resistance will decrease. BIA was performed using a body composition analyzer (Akern Srl, Florence, Italy). This device employs four-electrode polarization and measures the resistance and reactance of a conductor to application of an alternating electric current of 800 μA and 50 kHz. All measurements were made with the patient supine, with their arms relaxed at their sides but not touching their body, and with their thighs slightly separated. Electrodes were placed on the dorsal surface of the skin of the wrist and ankle, with the detector electrodes applied along the articulation bisecting line of both joints. BIA was performed at baseline and 4, 6, 8 and 22 hours after endotoxin administration.BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.DRUGS AND SOLUTIONS:All solutions were freshly prepared on the day of the experiment. Endotoxin from Escherichia coli (batch 0:113, lot G2B274) was obtained from US Pharmacopia Convention (Rockville, MD, USA) and dissolved in normal saline 0.9% to a concentration of 200 EU/ml (0.1 ml/kg). I125-albumin (Iodinated [125I] Human Serum Albumin; code IM 17 P) was obtained from Amersham International (Amersham, UK).BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.DATA ANALYSIS, CALCULATIONS AND STATISTICS:Power analysis was based on clinically relevant changes in TER-Alb. In a previous study using the TER-alb method, we found a standard deviation ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%. An increase in transcapillary escape rate of 2.5% was considered clinically relevant. With an estimated standard deviation of 2% and α = 0.05, we calculated that a sample size of seven individuals per group would be needed to achieve a power of 95%. Therefore, eight individuals per group were included.  TER-alb was calculated and expressed as the percentage disappearance per hour. Fluid filtration capacity (Kf) was determined by venous occlusion plethysmography in both forearms and averaged. The mean Kf was used for further calculations. A change in the ratio of ECW/TBW was taken to give an impression of microvascular permeability, using BIA.  Student\\'s t-tests or analysis of variance with repeated measures were used for the assessment of the effects of endotoxin on microvascular permeability parameters. All data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean of n experiments unless otherwise stated. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.BODY.RESULTS:Demographic characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences between the groups.BODY.RESULTS.CHANGES IN CLINICAL AND INFLAMMATORY PARAMETERS:The first flu-like symptoms (headache, nausea, chills) occurred in the endotoxin-treated group between 55 and 90 min after LPS injection. Body temperature started to rise 1 hour after endotoxin administration to a maximum of 38.7 ± 0.3°C at 4 hours versus 36.9 ± 0.2°C in the control group (P < 0.001). At 8 hours all clinical symptoms had declined to control values. The clinical onset of inflammation was accompanied by a sudden rise in TNF-α plasma levels at 60 min (373 ± 71 pg/ml), which reached its zenith at 90 min (856 ± 158 pg/ml), closely followed by a rise in IL-1β that was maximal at 120 min (23.9 ± 2.2 pg/ml). C-reactive protein increased from under 5 mg/ml at baseline to 22.3 ± 1.4 mg/ml at 12 hours after endotoxin administration and reached its maximum at 22 hours (38.9 ± 3.0 mg/ml). In the control individuals no elevations in temperature (from 36.9 ± 0.1 to 37.0 ± 0.1°C), clinical symptoms, cytokine levels (TNF-α <8 pg/ml, IL-1β <8 pg/ml) or C-reative protein (<5 mg/ml) were observed (Fig. 1).BODY.RESULTS.CHANGES IN HAEMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS:Figure 2 shows the course of heart rate, mean arterial pressure and forearm blood flow in the endotoxin and control group. In the control group the mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 88 to 80 mmHg at 6 hours (P = 0.035); the blood pressure decreased significantly more in the individuals administered LPS (from 96 ± 3 mmHg to 79 ± 4 mmHg at 6 hours, P < 0.0001; difference from control individuals: P = 0.002). Heart rate remained unchanged in the control group (from 66 ± 4 to 65 ± 2 beats/min; not significant) and increased from 63 ± 3 to 91 ± 3 beats/min at 6 hours in the LPS group (P < 0.0001). Forearm blood flow increased from 3.7 ± 0.6 to 6.8 ± 1.1 ml/min per dl at 6 hours (P = 0.018) in the endotoxin group, but remained unchanged in the control group (3.8 ± 0.8 versus 4.4 ± 0.9 ml/min per dl; not significant).BODY.RESULTS.CHANGES IN MICROVASCULAR PERMEABILITY PARAMETERS:In neither the endotoxin group nor the control group were significant alterations in microvascular permeability parameters detected. In the endotoxin group TER-alb was 7.2 ± 0.6%/hour before and 7.7 ± 0.9%/hour at 4.5 hours after endotoxin administration (not significant); Kf remained unchanged (from 5.0 ± 0.3 to 4.2 ± 0.4 ml/min per 100 ml mmHg × 10-3; not significant); and ECW/TBW, as measured by BIA, did not change (from 0.42 ± 0.01 l/l to 0.40 ± 0.01 l/l; not significant). Also, no significant changes in microvascular permeability parameters were found in the control group (all not significant: TER-alb from 9.08 ± 1.28 to 10.38 ± 0.63%/hour; Kf from 4.14 ± 0.42 to 5.17 ± 0.39 ml/min per 100 ml mmHg × 10-3; and ECW/TBW from 0.43 ± 0.01 l/l to 0.42 ± 0.01 l/l). The effect of endotoxin on microvascular parameters is shown in Fig. 3.BODY.DISCUSSION:Although administration of endotoxin to human volunteers has facilitated sepsis-associated research, the present study demonstrates that human experimental endotoxaemia is not a suitable model in which to study sepsis-induced changes in microvascular permeability. In a negative study the first issue to address is methodology. We conducted the present study with all three methods that are available for human in vivo experiments. Differences in microvascular permeability have been detected in various other diseases with these methods [13-17]. In septic patients an increase in Kf was demonstrated with TER-alb [18], VCP [19] and BIA [20]. In view of the ability of these methods to detect differences in microvascular permeability and the consistently negative findings of all three methods used in this endotoxin study, we believe our results are valid.  There are several possible reasons for our negative findings. First, the inflammatory stimulus might not have been sufficiently powerful. Endotoxin is known to stimulate the immune system in a dose-dependent manner [25]. Indeed, a marked increase in permeability in vivo has previously been shown in, for example, cats after intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg endotoxin [10]. On one occasion, an autointoxication with 1 mg of Salmonella endotoxin resulted in profound vasodilatory shock and a 15 l cumulative fluid balance over 72 hours in a laboratory worker [34]. This demonstrates unequivocally that high doses of endotoxin can cause shock and vascular leakage. In human volunteers an endotoxin concentration of 4 ng/kg is considered the maximal tolerable dose. The concentration of 2 ng/kg is widely applied and results in systemic inflammation, activation of coagulation pathways and distinct haemodynamic changes. Although the rise in proinflammatory cytokines is dose dependent, studies that used 4 ng/kg LPS found changes in clinical parameters similar to those reported here (e.g. rise in body temperature and fall in blood pressure) [35]. In the individuals included in the present study (who received 2 ng/kg) the flu-like symptoms, rise in body temperature, rise in heart rate, fall in blood pressure and rise in C-reactive protein were considerable; we therefore believe that the inflammatory stimulus was adequate. Also, the TNF-α and IL-1β concentrations in these individuals exceeded considerably the threshold levels of 50 pg/ml and 20 pg/ml, respectively, that are necessary to increase permeability significantly in vitro [6].  Naturally, it remains difficult for many reasons to compare an in vitro study in endothelial cells of large vessels with our in vivo experiment. The human endotoxaemia model is currently the only available in vivo human model that mimics Gram-negative sepsis. Whereas in experimental endotoxaemia the stimulus is restricted to LPS, other (non-LPS) bacterial components are also of importance for the induction of cytokines and the inflammatory response [36] and possibly the induction of vascular leakage. These differences could represent the reason why therapies directed at endotoxaemia itself are not of benefit in patients with septic shock [37]. However, as a model, the changes in haemodynamics that occur during human endotoxaemia are similar to those observed in septic shock, and suggest that endotoxin is a major mediator of the cardiovascular dysfunction that occurs in this condition [35].  A second possible reason for our negative findings is that not only the peak concentration of cytokines but also the duration of the increased level of the inflammatory mediators may be important in the pathophysiology of oedema formation in sepsis. The stimulus caused by a single bolus injection of endotoxin may be too short to induce an increase in microvascular permeability. The induction of capillary leakage in vitro was accomplished after incubation with endotoxin or cytokines for 6 hours [6]. Also, in pre-eclampsia a sustained rise in plasma cytokines is associated with an increase in microvascular permeability, suggesting a causal relationship [38]. However, although in some cases of sepsis in humans (e.g. meningococcal disease) elevated serum levels of TNF-α have been found in up to 90% of patients [39], several other clinical studies in septic patients reported only minimally elevated or undetectable levels of TNF-α [40,41]. Because these patients exhibit an overt increase in microvascular permeability, sustained high cytokine levels are apparently not mandatory for the development of oedema.  A third reason is that the timing of the measurements might not have been optimal for the detection of changes in permeability. In previous studies maximal changes in haemodynamic parameters were found between 2 and 6 hours after administration of endotoxin [35]. Because these vascular changes can partly be accounted for by endothelial dysfunction [42], we opted to measure microvascular permeability in the same time window. The possibility that an increase in permeability occurred outside the time window of interest appears unlikely because BIA was unchanged at five time points during the experiment, and Kf was also unaltered at 22 hours after endotoxin administration. Timing may be of critical importance because an accelerated plasma efflux of albumin was only observed during the early phase of sepsis in rats [43]. Also, late-acting cytokines (e.g. high mobility group protein 1) remain elevated for 16–32 hours after the administration of endotoxin and may play a role in the capillary leak found in septic patients. This and possibly other mediators were not measured during our experiment. Again, BIA and VCP measurements after 22 hours did not reveal an increase in vascular permeability in our experiments, suggesting that a possible late increase in vascular permeability was not missed.  Finally, oedema formation may differ from tissue to tissue and from organ to organ. In human endotoxaemia increases in intestinal permeability [44] and alveolar epithelial permeability [45] were previously demonstrated. In contrast, human endotoxaemia did not induce an increase in the ocular blood–aqueous barrier [46]. With the TER-alb and BIA whole body permeability is assessed, whereas the Filtrass strain gauge plethysmograph focuses on the forearms. An increase in microvascular permeability in, for example, the lungs was not specifically assessed, but if it was present it was insufficient to affect whole body permeability. Administration of iodated albumin as a measure of capillary leak may vary with hydration status, and albumin molecules might be too large to be useful as a sensitive permeability marker. However, these problems are overcome with the use of VCP. We believe that fluid loading would not have altered transcappilary leakage, because with the VCP method a venous occlusion pressure is applied to the forearms, so that vascular permeability is measured independent of the volume status of the subject. The suggestion that permeability might have been increased for smaller molecules than albumin can be ruled out for the same reason.  In summary, we do not believe that the methods used, the timing of the permeability measurements, or the absolute maximal cytokine concentrations can account for the observed lack of effect of endotoxin on microvascular permeability in humans. However, the short duration of cytokine increase possibly played a role.BODY.CONCLUSION:Although endotoxin administration to humans has proven to be a valuable model for studying systemic inflammation and coagulation, this model cannot be used to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie capillary leakage in sepsis or to evaluate pharmacological interventions aimed at attenuating the increase in microvascular permeability.BODY.KEY MESSAGES:• \\tEndotoxin administration to humans is a valuable model in which to investigate inflammatory and haemodynamic mechanisms in sepsis.  • \\tEndotoxin administration to humans does not affect microvascular permeability measured using TER-alb, VCP and BIA.  • \\tEndotoxin administration can not be used as a model to study the pathopysiological mechanisms that underlie capillary leakage in sepsis, or to evaluate the pharmacological interventions aimed at restoring normal microvascular permeability.BODY.ABBREVIATIONS:BIA = bioelectrical impedance analysis; ECW = extracellular water; IL = interleukin; Kf = filtration capacity; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; TER-alb = transcapillary escape rate of I125-albumin; TNF = tumour necrosis factor; TBW = total body water; VCP = venous congestion plethysmography.BODY.COMPETING INTERESTS:The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.BODY.AUTHORS\\' CONTRIBUTIONS:LTGJvE (medical student) carried out the experiments, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
